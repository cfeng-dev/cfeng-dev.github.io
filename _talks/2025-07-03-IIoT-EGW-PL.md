Project presentation as part of the *Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)* module on the design and implementation of an edge gateway (FR201 OnLogic) integrated with the IoT platform ThingsBoard.

The presentation addressed the processing and forwarding of process data via MQTT, the visualization of process data on [ThingsBoard](https://thingsboard.io), and the use of RPC/MQTT for sending control commands from the platform to the [FR201 OnLogic](https://www.onlogic.com/store/fr201/) edge gateway. It also discussed the overall system architecture and data flow, the transformation of process data into a flat JSON format using Node-RED, and the control of the OPC UA server sampling rate through ThingsBoard RPC. 

The presentation was given in German.
