Conference talk at **FUSE-KI 2025** (*Future of Electrical Systems Engineering in the Age of Generative KI*) on the role of prompt engineering as a key skill for modern engineers.

Based on a peer-reviewed conference paper, the talk explored the fundamentals of prompt engineering, its applications in generative AI, and two core methods: *In-Context Learning* and *Step-by-Step Reasoning*. It discussed research findings, practical use cases, and potential challenges, highlighting how well-designed prompts can improve large language model performance. 

The presentation was given in English.
