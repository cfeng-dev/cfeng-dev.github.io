Internship presentation as part of the *Praxissemester* (internship) module, covering my work experience in the SRS department, which is responsible for control, regulation, and software-related tasks for heat and climate generators.  

During the internship at [Hoval AG](https://www.hoval.com), a heating and ventilation systems manufacturer headquartered in Vaduz, Liechtenstein, my tasks included developing software for a new heat pump configuration application, implementing backend code in JavaScript, designing unit tests, testing heat pump components with the new application, and performing debugging and error analysis.  

The presentation also described the company's background, its role in the environmentally friendly heating technology sector, and reflected on the benefits and challenges of working in Liechtenstein.  

The presentation was given in German.
