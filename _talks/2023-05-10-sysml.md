Presentation as part of the *Systems Architecture* module â€” a non-credit, pass/fail requirement (German: Schein) â€” on the fundamentals and applications of the Systems Modeling Language (SysML).  

The talk covered an introduction to systems and systems engineering, the SIMILAR process model, model-based systems engineering (MBSE), and the purpose and benefits of SysML. It discussed the relationship and differences between SysML and UML, the various diagram types (requirements, block definition, internal block, and parametric diagrams), and their usage in real-time systems. The presentation also addressed SysML tools, and the advantages and disadvantages of using SysML in complex system design.  

The presentation was given in English.
