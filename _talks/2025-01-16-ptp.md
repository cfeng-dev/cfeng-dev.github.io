The presentation explained the protocol's position within the OSI model, its master-slave architecture, clock types, and operation in 1-step and 2-step modes. It also described the sequence of message exchanges for synchronization, highlighted applications in telecommunications, finance, energy, and industrial automation, and discussed advantages and limitations. The presentation was given in German.
