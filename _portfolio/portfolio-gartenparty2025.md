## Overview
In 2025, I developed a **lightweight event website** to streamline the organization of a garden party with **30+ guests**.  
The goal was to automate RSVPs, reduce manual coordination, and provide all essential details (location, time, notes) in one central place.  
→ [**Live Website**](https://gartenparty2025.netlify.app)  
→ [**View Source Code on GitHub**](https://github.com/cfeng-dev/GartenParty2025)

Unlike commercial website builders such as WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace, this site is **completely free to host** (via Netlify) and the **entire source code** is accessible at any time on GitHub — giving full control over customization and data.

## Features
- **RSVP form** with structured fields, validation, and visual feedback
- **Dual-language interface**: English / German toggle
- **Location & directions**: Google Maps embedding + “Parking Info” section
- **Responsive design** with mobile-friendly navigation
- **Deployment pipeline**: GitHub → Netlify (auto-build on every commit)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Hosting/CI:** Netlify (auto-deploy from GitHub)
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git, GSAP (scroll animations), SweetAlert for dialogs

## Architecture & Deployment
Code is hosted on **GitHub**, with **Netlify** set up to automatically build and deploy whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.  
This ensures the site is always up-to-date within seconds.
