I am from Taiwan and currently pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering at [HTWG Konstanz](https://www.htwg-konstanz.de/en/) in Germany. My primary interest lies in **software development** for electrical applications, complemented by a focus on **machine learning** and **embedded systems**.

During a software development internship at [Hoval](https://www.hoval.com/en/) in Liechtenstein, I worked on a **Modbus configurator** for heat pump systems. I optimized scripts with **JavaScript** through modularization, reducing system configuration and testing time. I also wrote unit tests using **Jest**, enhancing the tool's reliability.

For my Bachelor's thesis, I implemented and compared three different models in **Python** for electricity consumption forecasting: a deep learning approach (**LSTM**), a machine learning method (**XGBoost**), and a statistical technique (**ARIMA**). The goal was to determine which model provides the best prediction accuracy with the shortest training time.

As part of a collaborative project during my studies, my fellow students and I developed an embedded system for real-time wind condition monitoring to optimize wind power applications. We utilized **Arduino** as the main controller, integrating **Modbus** for sensor communication and **MQTT** for data transmission.

When not working, I can be found on the basketball court or in the kitchen, cooking spicy Asian specialties.
