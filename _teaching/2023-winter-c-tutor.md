From **September 24, 2023** to **January 23, 2024**, I conducted a weekly **90-minute** C programming tutorial for **18 students** from the *International Engineering and Management* (IWI) program at HTWG Konstanz.

The tutorial covered the full range of introductory C programming topics, including:

- Installation and setup of Eclipse IDE, TDM-GCC, and Java Runtime Environment (JRE)  
- Understanding Nassi–Shneiderman diagrams for program structuring  
- Variables, data types, control structures, and loops  
- Arrays, functions, and pointers

In addition to teaching, my responsibilities also included:

- Assisting the professor with the mock examination ("Scheinprüfung")  
- Supervising the actual examination and assessing student performance (pass/fail)  
- Creating a **Practical Tips** PDF to support students in preparing for the exam and improving their coding skills
